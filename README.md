This repository contains the source code for the admin and user portals of my Final Year Project. Additionally, it includes all project-related documents, diagrams, and resources.

## Introduction

This project serves as my Final Year Project and consists of two main components: the admin portal and the user portal. The admin portal is responsible for overseeing and managing the user website. It enables administrators to view and modify user orders, making it a centralized platform for monitoring and updating the user-facing aspects of the project., while the user portal is a web platform on which users can easily buy food and nutrition for poultry or agriculture and livestock and we are also giving our users medical consultation through doctors and blogs that are uploaded on our website with time.
We are also giving our website the advanced machine learning crop disease recommender system that will help our user find out which disease his crops have through images.
